# QSimpleScada
Qt/C++ based simple SCADA framework, with dashboard, static and dynamic components. By using QSimpleScada framework you can build complex SCADA uis for your needs.

# Minimum requirements
Qt 5.8

# Installing with qpm
Just use qpm (https://www.qpm.io/) to install QSimpleScada in your project. Run qpm install com.indeema.QSimpleScada . in *.pro file include(vendor/Vendor.pri)

Or Compile QSimpleScada with QSimpleScada pro file, you will receive QSimpleScadaLib folder with compiled windows or macos libs.

# Sample

You can check examples that uses QSimpleScada https://github.com/IndeemaSoftware/QSimpleScadaSample

# How to start

First create your device

```cpp
   QScadaDeviceInfo *lDeviceInfo = new QScadaDeviceInfo();
   lDeviceInfo->setName("Test Device");
   lDeviceInfo->setIp(QHostAddress("127.0.0.1"));
```

Then init your board controller. Your boardcontroller object is main contact spot.
```cpp
   QScadaBoardController *mController = new QScadaBoardController();   
   mController->appendDevice(lDeviceInfo);
```
Now init your board
```cpp
   mController->initBoardForDeviceIp("127.0.0.1");
```

You can connect to signals, to handle events
```cpp
signals:
    void objectDoubleClicked(QScadaObject*);
```
You can get pointers to specific board by calling methods:
```cpp
    QList<QScadaBoard*> getBoardList();
    QList<QScadaBoard*> getBoardListForDeviceIp(QString);
```
Next just make your controller editable or static. That depends on your needs.
```cpp
    mController->setEditingMode(true);
```

Now just puth controllwe widget to you central widget
```cpp
   QGridLayout *mainLayout = new QGridLayout(ui->centralWidget);
   mainLayout->addWidget(mController);
```

Now your board controller is initialized. Next steps are setting ups widget resources.
Weâ€™ve also developed a EEIoT library with a set of preconfigured widgets. You can download it at https://github.com/IndeemaSoftware/EEIoT and try it out as a start. Read wiki page to know rules on [how to create qml widgets that can be used by QSimpleScada](https://github.com/IndeemaSoftware/QSimpleScada/wiki/How-to-create-QML-Widgets)

To use a widget collection:
Call the function with url to QML resources to let the controller know the location of QML widgets:
```cpp
    QMLConfig::instance.appendQMLPath(:/com/indeema/eeiot/EEIoT/);
```
Path :/com/indeema/eeiot/EEIoT/ is added by default so you don't need to add it manually. If you call appendQMLPath with different path to EEIoT it will replace default path. Also you can add your custom widgets.

You can use our simple editor to create your first dashboard https://github.com/IndeemaSoftware/QSimpleScadaSample 

Then set up QScadaBoardController in your app without any devices and boards and call:
```cpp
    mController->openProject(QString <file>)
```

where <file> is a full path to your project file (*.irp)

For example:
```cpp
    mController->openProject(QString <file>)
```
